# graph-shortest-paths
This project is done as part of course work for design and analysis of algorithms at UTA. Algorithms covered are breadth first search traversal, dijkstra algorithm, bellman ford algorithm

To run all algorithms - run the main application => python3 main.py

To run only bfs - run the main application with command line arg bfs => **python3 main.py bfs**

To run only dijkstra - run the main application with command line arg dijkstra => **python3 main.py dijkstra**

To run only bellman_ford - run the main application with command line arg bellman_ford => **python3 main.py bellman_ford**

To run with custom command line input - add cmd_input to command as cmd line arg => **python3 main.py cmd_input** or **python3 main.py cmd_input bfs**
